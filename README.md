This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A Simple Progress Bar Built with React

- There are two main components that make up this bar: `ProgressBar` and `Status`.
  - `ProgressBar` is the parent div that holds the progress percentage.
  - `Status` is the div that represents the current progress, which fills the parent div. This component will fill up a percentage of the container.
